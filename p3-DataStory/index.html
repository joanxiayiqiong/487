      <h1 class="jumbotron-heading">Exploring the U.S. Gender Salary Gap by Occupation Through the Public Dataset</h1>
      <p class="lead text-muted">Nearly every occupation in the United States experiences a gender wage gap. In 2017, it was commonly known that women were paid on average 82 cents for every dollar a man earns. However, based on the controlled data, the gap varies significantly by field. Women are paid almost half of what men are paid (56.3%) in some legal occupations such as financial clerks, while architectural and engineering managers experience almost no gap (99.9%). <br></p>
      <p class="lead text-muted">Considering the complexity of the gender pay gap issue, this data-driven dashboard analyzes the gender wage gap by occupation through reported earnings by gender using data from the American Community Survey.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="#c1" class="btn btn-primary my-2 btn-sm">Common Occupations</a>
        <a href="#c2" class="btn btn-danger my-2 btn-sm">General Field</a>

      <!-- chart1 Common Occupation -->
  <div id="c1" class="album py-5 bg-light">
    <div class="container">
      <div id="commonOccup" style="width:80%;min-width: 360px; height: 500px; margin: 0 auto"></div>
    </div>
      <p class="lead text-muted" style="margin:3rem  20%;"> &emsp;&emsp;This controlled dataset indicates a notable gender wage gap exists in most of the common occupations where massive male and female employees work in the same field. <br> &emsp;&emsp;Particularly, jobs including business, science, and arts management and healthcare practitioners and technicals show the greatest differences between female's and male's salaries. The gaps between these median wages are even larger than $20,000 (26%). <br></p>
  </div>

  <!-- chart2 General Field -->

  <section >
    <div id="c2" class="container">
      <div id="generalField" style="max-width: 800px;min-width: 360px; margin: 3rem auto;padding-top:2rem;"></div>
      <p class="lead text-muted" style="margin:3rem  20%;">&emsp;&emsp;Within the 558 occupational categories, the data also specified the women's earnings as a percentage of men's earnings. The above chart visualized partial occupations which reported the pay gap based on their large enough sample sizes. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Some job fields like dietitians and nutritionists, first-line supervisors, operating engineers, agricultural inspectors have the greatest percentage differences, which are greater than 100%. Works such as financial clerks, car operators, and security and financial sales agents own the relatively low pay difference. </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- chart3 Male Dominant -->
<div id="c3" class="album py-5 bg-light">
<div class="container">
  <div id="maleDominant" style="width:80%;min-width: 360px; height: 600px; margin: 0 auto"></div>

</div>
  <p class="lead text-muted" style="margin:3rem  20%;">&emsp;&emsp;The wage gap goes beyond just earnings by field and occupation. Factors such as career disruption and working tasks (e.g. the majority of the construction or moving jobs requiring physical strength) are inevitably male-dominant. Women also leave the workforce for circumstances like child-bearing or family care) significantly impact the gender pay gap. The gap widens even more.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In other word, the pay gap is not simply a gender issue but also relates to societal factors. Several controlled dataset analysis was further conducted focusing on the percentage of the gender workers and the level of the occupations. <br>&emsp;&emsp;The Above chart and the graphic below demonstrate the difference between male's and female's salaries in male dominant and women dominant job fields. </p>
</div>

<!-- chart4 Female Dominant -->

<section >
  <div id="c4" class="container">
      <div id="femaleDominant" style="width:80%;min-width: 360px; height: 600px; margin: 3rem auto"></div>
      <p class="lead text-muted" style="margin:3rem  20%;">&emsp;&emsp;Comparing the two charts, the electrician is the top one highly paid male-dominant job. On the women's field, speech-language pathologists and registered nurses are in the high end. Comparing the remaining jobs, both male's and female's salaries shift in a range from $20,000 to $40,000 without large variation. </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- chart5 Top Occupation -->
<div id="c5" class="album py-5 bg-light">
<div class="container">
<div id="topOccupation" style="max-width: 80%;min-width: 310px; height: 400px; margin: 0 auto"></div>
</div>
<p class="lead text-muted" style="margin:3rem  20%;">&emsp;&emsp;In addition to a wage gap, the dataset also indicates an opportunity gap - regarding the high-level occupations with a relatively larger population, like Chief Executives, Lawyers, and Computer Engineers who earn high pay, there are fewer women in the advanced positions or the higher-level of the organizations. This phenomenon also relates to the average difference in pay for services rendered or work performed between men and women due to the lack of competitiveness in the leading roles. <br></p>
