        <p>Total annual number of deaths by high-level cause category: <br>
        Communicable and other diseases include maternal, neonatal,and nutritional disease. <br>
        Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) include cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes and respiratory disease. Injuries include road accidents, homicides and conflict, drowning, fire-related accidents, natural disasters and self-harm. <br>
        At a global level we see that the majority of deaths are attributed to the category of non-communicable diseases (NCDs); these are chronic, long-term illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases (including stroke), respiratory disease, cancers and diabetes.  Collectively NCDs account for more than 70 percent of global deaths.</p>

        <p>Total annual number of deaths from all causes, broken down by broad age categories.<br>The demographics of deaths has changed significantly since 1990 with a notable shift from young-to-old. In 1990 nearly one-quarter of all deaths were in children under 5 years old. In 2017, this had declined to just under 10 percent. In contrast, the share of deaths in the over-70s age bracket has increased from 33 percent to 49 percent over this period.</p>

        <p>Total annual number of deaths by risk factor, measured across all age groups and both sexes.<br>The contribution of specific risk factors varies significantly by country. For most high-income countries, the dominant risk factors are those related to healthy diets, smoking and alcohol intake. Other risk factors such as clean water, sanitation, and child wasting or stunting are very low. In low-income countries the inverse is true: in Sierra Leone for example, the top risk factors include child wasting, household air pollution, unsafe water source, poor sanitation, and no access to handwashing facilities. </p>
