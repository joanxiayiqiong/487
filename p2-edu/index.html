      <p class="sentence text">A baby carrot is a carrot sold at a smaller size before reaching maturity. Despite its adorable name, Most baby carrots sold in U.S. supermarkets are really what the industry calls “baby cuts." These babies are actually whole, imperfect, craggy-looking carrots that are sliced into smaller pieces, sculpted into rounded sticks, washed and packaged for our snacking convenience.</p>

      <h3>Banana's father - Cavendish</h3>
      <p id="greeting" class="sentence text" style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;font-size:16px;"> The cheery yellow Cavendish banana in our grocery stores was named after William Cavendish. His gardeners were the first to grow the fruit in the extraordinary greenhouses at Chatsworth House in the 1830s. The banana was brought into large-scale cultivation soon after.</p>

      <h3>Seeds Disappeared in Bananas</h3>
      <p id="greeting" class="sentence text" style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;font-size:16px;">Although fruits — including wild bananas — have seeds that can be grown to make new fruits, Cavendish bananas are cultivated from clones, or genetically identical plants grown asexually on the roots of a mother plant. This process results in the same predictably delicious fruit produced generation after generation.</p>

    <div class="column-3">
      <img class="bnnimg" src="img/bnn2.jpg" alt=""/>
      <h3>Thick Skin and Protection</h3>
      <p id="greeting" class="sentence text" style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;font-size:16px;">The Cavendish banana became popular worldwide in the 1950s because of its resistance to Panama Disease, which decimated the previous popular banana variety. With its thicker skin, the Cavendish was easier for growers to ship with less bruising than other varieties. Today the Cavendish variety represents 99 percent of commercially exported bananas. </p>

    <p class="sentence text">The eggplant was named because of its original resemblance to <span style="color:white;">a small, white egg </span>when it was first encountered by English speakers. Since then, it has grown through selective breeding into a large, fleshy, purple mass. The shape and color changed as people bred eggplant into varieties with less bitter flesh and a larger nutritional yield packed into a single fruit.</p>

  <h2>Like an Egg, not a Plant.</h2>
  <p class="sentence text">Most people would probably guess eggplant is a vegetable. However, it’s actually the fruit of a plant of the same name. Eggplants are also closely related to tomatoes and potatoes. Eggplants grow wild, but they’re also grown as an annual crop in areas with a mild climate.</p>

    <p class="sentence text">It is a human invention, a plant that does not exist naturally in the wild. Corn can only survive if planted and protected by humans. It was started from a wild grass called teosinte, which looked very different from our corn today. The kernels were small and were not placed close together like kernels on the husked ear of modern corn. </p>

A cross-section of the one in the painting, which was made between 1645 and 1672, appears to have swirly shapes embedded in six triangular pie-shaped pieces.</p>
